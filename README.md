Personal site and blog. Writing about code, games, and whatever else is on my mind.

## the journey

Like many devs, I fall curse to the cycle of rewriting my own blog too often.

`LAMP` → `Rails` → `Gatsby` → `Next.js` → `Qwik` → `Astro` → **`SvelteKit`**

Each migration taught me something. Svelte feels right for what I want, now though, which is the power to build some higher fidelity experiences / posts / lab it up while still keeping the JS payload lean on content-driven pages.

Astro gave me a lot in basically zero JS, but as soon as I wanted to build more complex cross-page experiences or what-have-you I ended up fighting it. SvelteKit has been a solid inbetween for what I like to build here.
