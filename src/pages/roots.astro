        <h2>The Journey So Far</h2>
        <p>It all started in the Blue Ridge Mountains, Southern Virginia.</p>
        <p>
          Enter me. Typical 90s nerd nurtured on Digimon and Froot Roll-ups. I
          stumbled into programming at around age 10, spurred by the grinding of
          two tectonic plates in my life:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>my family's relative poverty</li>
          <li>and my love for video games</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          By the early aughts, I spent my nights fighting dial up to play games
          on the internet. Runescape, Maplestory, WoW, etc. If I could find a
          way to play it at the local library, I was on it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Around then, my dad (who worked at the local library) introduced me to
          these cute stacks of colored squares, "Floppy Disks". They were neat.
          He showed me how to write little DOS programs on them and mod games,
          probably expecting me to get bored of it.
        </p>

        <p>
          I did not get bored. At first, I tried my hand at making games on them
          and selling them, but it turned out the kids at my school really did
          not care for my amateur game design skills (at least not enough to pay
          for it).
        </p>
        <p>It was also really fucking hard to make games.</p>
        <p>
          But after some conniving, I found I could write Runescape bots! And
          the kids at school ate that up at 5-10c a disk.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sadly, no chump change was going to save my parents' marriage. I also
          got banned from Runescape and that may have soured my ambition.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, coding those floppies was enough of a gateway drug to make me
          want to learn more.
        </p>

        <h3>Wanderlust</h3>

        <p>
          From here I ventured to Oberlin College with a vague goal to study
          computer science. Fortunately, Oberlin (like many liberal arts
          colleges) was the perfect place for someone like me who had no clue
          what the fuck they were doing. In 2015, I narrowly earned my Bachelor
          of Arts in Computer Science. I say narrowly because I was an awful
          student. I'll spare you the typical coming-of-age details.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the flip, my mediocre grades were a poor reflection of how much I
          grew. But I digress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Determined to continue the theme of general wanderlust, I followed the
          winds with close friends to Madison, WI.
        </p>

        <p>
          I came armed with 4 years of deep and mostly useless experience
          repairing printers, laptops, & desktops, a gallery of side projects
          and half-finished apps, the emotional undertow of a guttering and
          newly long distance relationship, a mild caffeine addiction, and my
          minted degree in theoretical problem solving.
        </p>
        <p>
          In other words, I was ready for a Real Midwestern existential crisis.
          (Tip: if you're looking for a place to have an existential crisis,
          look no further than the sub-zero, snow covered lakecity of Madison.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, I quit the lackluster IT job I worked upon arrival, ran
          out of money, and by the summer of '16 fled home for some soul
          searching. I spent that summer helping my family fix up my childhood
          home, intent to sell. There's a stereotype that returning home is a
          "bad thing", a uniquely western cultural faux pas. Growing up, I
          wanted nothing more than to be out of my hometown, far from the chaos
          of a broken family. The surreal blue-green gradient of the Blue Ridge
          Mountains was a noisy vignette in my rearview mirror.
        </p>
        <p>
          But on coming back? Holy shit. Nothing hits like those mountains after
          living in the flat, unchanging midwest for 5 years.
        </p>
        <p>And so I began healing.</p>
        <p>
          After a summer of hard labor, I rekindled my love for programming,
          returned to Madison, and landed a gig as an instructor at a tech
          summer camp--the kind where bougie parents send their kids to "learn
          to code in a week." Therein I found an unexpected love for teaching. I
          remember thinking there was nothing greater than the glow of a kid
          hacking their first game or website together. Maybe I remembered
          myself in that glow.
        </p>
        <p>
          That propelled me into the next couple years working for a local
          non-profit where I taught girls and students of color programming, CS,
          and the like. At night I dawned the cloak of my other unexpected
          hobby-turned-profession: bartending. It's hard to explain the simple
          joy of mixing cocktails, sweating through a rush, and learning how to
          strike up a conversation with literally anyone. I won't attempt it
          here, but suffice it to say the juxtaposition of physically taxing
          work (tending bar) and mentally taxing work (teaching) is soup for the
          soul, the kind of work you could grow content on.
        </p>
        <p>But I was in my 20s. Content was not it.</p>

        <h3>Rekindling</h3>

        <p>
          When I originally left Oberlin, I spurned my CS colleagues for their
          near-obsessive desire to interview and work at FANG companies. It
          simply didn't sit right with me (yes, I was insufferable). However,
          the more I taught others to code, the more I found myself wondering
          what I was missing. I never really spent time in "big tech", only
          small, comfortingly-adjacent tech (re: content).
        </p>
        <p>
          I still had little desire to work at a FANG (for posterity, I did
          interview and was rejected twice), but I wanted to see complex
          software at scale.
        </p>
        <p>
          Around that time I met my wife-to-be and promptly fell in love (we met
          at a vegan pizza party/activism event, which should tell you
          everything). The early flames of our relationship stoked my ambition,
          and in late 2018 we said our farewells to Madison.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still firmly in the grip of the midwest (it really never lets go), we
          moved to a quaint apartment in downtown Columbus, OH. My wife had
          family in the area, and I landed a good job as a software engineer at
          a massive energy enterprise (re: scale).
        </p>
        <p>
          The work was boring. Sorry, that's understatement. It was surreally
          mundane. 30+ floors of corporate office layout, cubicles filled with
          passwords on sticky notes, bastardization of "agile", red tape to
          doing anything slightly interesting, cafeteria cliques, water cooler
          conversations, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Honestly though, I couldn't complain. The pay was more than I ever
          dreamed of as a poor southern kid, I never thought about work after
          work, and it scratched the itch I had for hairy, complex software at
          scale. But it was profoundly unfulfilling. Most of the people I worked
          with had been there for over a decade. Many aimed to retire there, and
          they were content. I was not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Toward the end of my time there the pandemic was just ramping up. I
          had (thankfully) been asked to work from home. I had also moved to a
          smaller team doing more modern frontend work, which is where my
          interests always were. No more IE11 support, and my coworkers had at
          least heard of ES6. I learned the enterprise arts of navigating
          bureaucracy, legacy systems, and corporate tribalism. More
          importantly, I learned what I didn't want: to be another cog.
        </p>

        <h3>Suddenly, Dad</h3>

        <p>
          In the Fall of 2020 I got the best news ever: I was going to be a dad.
          Life started moving real fast. I'm going to speedrun you through the
          next 12 months:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            got married outside of the downtown Columbus courthouse on a sunny
            day...
          </li>
          <li>
            left my corporate job for an e-commerce "startup". It wasn't
            actually a startup, but the engineering team was entirely new.
            Actually, this was the second fully new engineering team in two
            years. Somehow I missed this red flag. I traded corporate stability
            for the lavish chaos of modern tooling, frameworks, and building
            fast. I learned a lot about limits here. By the end of 2021, my
            teammates and I followed in the footsteps of the first two teams and
            left...
          </li>
          <li>
            welcomed my first daughter and discovered that no experience could
            possibly top hearing her laugh...
          </li>
          <li>bought my first house...</li>
          <li>
            and started a new job at GoodRx as a Lead Software Engineer on what
            would become the Frontend Platform team.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Engineering at GoodRx was good. It had its problems, like every
          mid-sized org trying to figure out how to keep growing post-IPO, but
          Engineering had potential.
        </p>
        <p>
          I grew in my role over 3 years there on the Frontend Platform team. I
          spent a lovely stint as a manager before realizing that, while I liked
          people, I didn't like them more than the craft. I found my way back to
          IC. After building a sophisticated frontend platform, mentoring teams,
          recording podcasts, and making a lot of friends, I stepped into the
          big "Principal Engineer" shoes.
        </p>

        <h3>Present</h3>

        <p>
          That brings us to the present arc. Vehemently in my early 30s, my wife
          and I grew the family in late 2024.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paternity gave me a lot of time to think, and I said farewell to
          GoodRx to join a small startup, Amino Health, as a Principal Engineer.
          It was a different kind of fast, the startup kind where I wore
          product, platform, and everything in between hats.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not 5 months after joining, we were acquired by <a
            href="https://www.cap-rx.com/">CapitalRx</a
          >, which is where I find myself today. As with all mergers, there's a
          lot to grow into, but right now it's a lot of fun. Going to ride that
          energy as long as I can.
